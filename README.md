# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe Game

-This is a project that I built with some guidance from Udemy.  This project uses arrays to run through a tic-tac-toe board and see if there is a winner.  This was a challenging task. The part I had the hardest with was trying to determine the winner of the right diagonal.
